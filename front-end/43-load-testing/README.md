## Learning Objectives
* Students will learn to add SocketIO to an express app
* Students will learn to add realtime features to their applications

## Message exchange patterns
In software architecture, a message pattern describes how two different parts of a message passing system communicate with each other. This can be over a network or between pieces of code. Theses communications patterns usually fall into the `push` or `pull` models. The push model is data driven, when the serving node has content to be published it will send the data out, without requiring a request from the receiving end. The pull model expects the serving node to wait for data to be requested by the receiving end, before sending it out.

#### Publish/Subscribe (Push)
Clients connect to Services and listen for events. Services publish data on events wether or not clients are listening.

#### Request/Response (Pull)
Clients connect to Services and make requests. Services respond to the requests directly with data.

## Browser Realtime
#### Websockets
Websockets are a realtime two way communication protocol over a TCP connection. Websockets are part of the HTML5 specification. They are designed to be implemented in browsers and web servers. Websocket connections are interpreted by HTTP servers as as an `UPGRADE` request. Websockets enable interaction between a browser and a webserver with lower overhead, enabling real time data transfer to and from the server. The communications are done over port 80 or 443 in case of TLS(SSL) connections.

#### Long Polling
Long polling is a technique used by older browsers to enable them get the effect of subscribing to the server. With long polling the client makes a request to the server, but the server is not expected to respond immediately. The server will respond only when the information becomes available. This is not technically a true push, but it allows the emulation of a push when websockets is not possible.
